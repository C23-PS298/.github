		National security and defense are very important for the country and its people, especially since we know that Indonesia is a big country. Therefore, good facilities are needed to guard the border areas in Indonesia because there are still many violations in the border areas, such as migration and illegal smuggling of goods. That's where SaBo came to help!

## Project Abstract
Indonesia is a massive country that shares a land border with three neighboring countries: Malaysia, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea. In total, it stretches over 3.151 km long. This very long border makes it difficult to guard and maintain its security. The Indonesian government always tries to keep the border safe and under control, but in some cases, there are also a lot of illegal activities that occur outside of the authority's knowledge. For instance, in 2023, two illegal Indonesian migrant workers were caught crossing the non-procedural path in Badau District, Kapuas Hulu, West Kalimantan, intending to work in Malaysian palm plantations. This is due to the lack of human and technological resources available at the guard posts. It is important to keep in mind that the current surveillance system is still insufficient because only three soldiers take turns to conduct surveillance every 24 hours. National security and defense are very important; therefore, good facilities are needed to guard the border areas in Indonesia. A solution is needed to improve border control and surveillance at the national border to prevent illegal activities and ensure the safety and security of the region; hence, we create a system that can detect objects and applications that provide notifications related to violations at the border.
